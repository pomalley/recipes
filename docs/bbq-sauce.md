## Ingredients

- 2/3 C ketchup
- 1/2 C cider vinegar
- 1/4 C brown sugar
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper

## Directions

Simmer for at least 5 minutes. If using on the grill, dilute with equal parts water.

For my taste, I'd reduce the vinegar a bit, but Anna likes it.
