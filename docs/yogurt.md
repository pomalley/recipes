## Ingredients

- 1/2 gallon milk
- 2 tbsp yogurt

## Directions

- Put the milk in the instant pot. Hit the "yogurt" button (twice) until it says "boil".
- Once the pot beeps, cool it to around 110 Â°F (e.g. ice bath in the sink).
- Skim off the top skin of the milk.
- Whisk in the yogurt.
- Dry the pot, put it back in the instant pot, and hit the yogurt button (once) so it says 8:00 (or however long you need, e.g. overnight).
- When this is done, put it in the fridge to cool, and then into jars.
